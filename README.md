# Senior_Design
This is our senior design project. There are four subsystems included in this repo:

## Navigation Algorithm
This navigation algorithm is a depth first, greedy algorithm, meaning this algorithm always looks to move forward in the robots current Orientation and then right, left, and turn around sequentially. The algorithm takes in a preset space to search and preset locations of obstacles and metal to demonstrate how the algorithm will work in reality when polling that information from sensors.

No physical implementation has been made so far as this subsystem relies on the completion of the physical implementations of the other subsystems. 

## Sensors and Motors
yet to be added, still working on physical implementation

## User Interfacing
yet to be added, still working on physical implementation

## Power Systems
yet to be added, probably nothing will be as most implementation is physical
