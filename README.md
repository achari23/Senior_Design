This is our senior design project. There are four subsystems included in this repo:

## Navigation Algorithm
This navigation algorithm is a depth first, greedy algorithm, meaning this algorithm always looks to move forward in the robots current Orientation and then right, left, and turn around sequentially. The algorithm takes in a preset space to search and preset locations of obstacles and metal to demonstrate how the algorithm will work in reality when polling that information from sensors.
